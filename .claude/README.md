# Livny Health - Clean, Modern EHR

## Project Philosophy
Livny Health is a modern EHR that breaks from the cluttered legacy feel of Epic/Cerner. 
We emphasize:
- **Progressive disclosure** - show only what's needed for current task
- **Ice/Nordic aesthetic** - clean, white space, subtle blue accents
- **Context-driven UI** - interface morphs based on what user is doing

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Pattern**: BFF (Backend for Frontend)
